Notes on chapter 2 & 3: Variables always have to have a name and a type. Primitive data types come in different sizes. You
can never use reserved java keywords in your names because they are already reserved, it will be marked as an error. There is no such thing as an object variable. There are only object reference variables, An object reference can only hold bits that represent how to access an object. It doesn't hold the object, but it holds something. But in Java, we really don't know what is inside a reference variable. We just know that it represents one object and one object only. The Java virtual machine knows how to utilize the reference to get to the object. The dot operator "." will invoke a method that you have created. The value "null" is not programmed to control anything. It is more of a placement holder. Arrays are objects too, it can contain primitive elements but the array itself is never a primitive. It remains an object. A class is a blueprint for your objects, it tells java how to make an object a particular way. Each object that is made from that class can have its own values for the instance variables of that class. The two utilizations of your main is to test your real class and to
start and launch your java application. You must have only one main method, just one. A class can inherit instance variables and methods from a more abstract superclass. The superclass is basically a parent class that can have subclasses(child classes) that can inherit its atrributes, methods, constructors. Methods represent the behavior of an object. Object Oriented Programming allows you to extend a program without having to touch already tested code that works/runs.
